We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Say you don't know me, or recognize my face
Say you don't care who goes to that kind of place
Knee-deep in the hoopla, sinking in your fight
Too many runaways eating up the night

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

Someone always playing corporation games
Who cares, they're always changing corporation names
We just want to dance here, someone stole the stage
They call us irresponsible, write us off the page

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock an' roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

It's just another Sunday
In a tired old street
Police have got the choke hold (oh)
Then we just lost the beat
Who counts the money underneath the bar?
Who writes the wrecking ball into our guitars?
Don't tell us you need us 'cause we're just simple fools
Looking for America, coming through your schools

(I'm looking out over that Golden Gate bridge)
(On another gorgeous sunny Saturday)
(And I'm seein' that bumper-to-bumper traffic)
Don't you remember, 'member
(It's your favorite radio station in your favorite radio city)
(The city by the bay, the city that rocks, the city that never sleeps)

Marconi plays the mamba
Listen to the radio
Don't you remember?
We built this city
We built this city on rock an' roll

We built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll
Built this city
We built this city on rock and roll

We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) we built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) we built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
(Built this city) we built, we built this city
We built, we built this city, yeah
