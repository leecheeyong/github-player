I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt
Turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous then I'm through with you

I burn, burn like a wicker cabinet
Chalk white and oh so frail
I see our time has gotten stale
The tick tock of the clock is painful
All sane and logical
I want to tear it off the wall
I hear words in clips and phrases
I think sick like ginger ale
But my stomach turns and I exhale

I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt
Turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous then I'm through with you

SoCal is where my mind states
But it's not my state of mind
I'm not as ugly sad as you
Or am I origami
Folded up and just pretend
Demented as the motives in your head

I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
But the lack thereof would leave me empty inside
I would swallow my doubt
Turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous then I'm through with you

I alone am the one you don't know you need
Take heed feed your ego
Make me blind when your eyes close
Sink when you get close, tie me to the bedpost

I alone am the one you don't know you need
You don't know you need me
But make me blind when your eyes close
Tie me to the bedpost

I would swallow my pride
I would choke on the rinds
The lack thereof would leave me empty inside
Swallow my doubt
Turn it inside out
Find nothin' but faith in nothin'
Want to put my tender heart in a blender
Watch it spin 'round to a beautiful oblivion
Rendezvous then I'm through
Now I'm through with you

Through with you

Rendezvous then I'm through with you
