Running from the morning
Think I hit a wall
Late nights, not you
Running from the moment
So I don't recall
Late nights, not you

Waking up in a cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
I'd do anything to not be alone
All alone with the ceiling
All alone with this feeling
And I wonder if I'll ever let go

I tried spending my nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

Drowning in my coffee
To wash the alcohol
Out my bloodstream
Sitting here I wonder
If we hadn't been at all
Who would I be?

Waking up in the cold sweat
Someone else in this cold bed
And I wonder if I'll ever let go

I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

Yeah yeah yeah
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you

I tried spending
My nights under
Someone new
But the truth is
I could spend my whole life getting over you

Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
Getting over you
