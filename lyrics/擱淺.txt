觸碰的柔軟 持續蔓延
像是船舶終於靠岸 太平洋溫度的纏綿
我甘願淪為 滄海一粟的平凡 卻只是今晚
You're telling me not to think too much
加主觀臆斷

你披著星辰來世界頂端
陌生熟悉的信任給我心安
You're too different from them, baby
I hope you know it, know it, know it
你的眼 流淌著波浪的藍
熙攘人潮湧動著舊愛新歡
I've been thinking about you lately
I hope you know it, know it, know it
你到底是否 在我身邊
像是鯨魚潮汐擱淺 陽光下低沈嗚咽
我渴望擁有微風看到的視野
漂浮上升空中 尋著你的行蹤
伴著你一路狂奔 卷起了漫天一路揚塵

你披著星辰來世界頂端
陌生熟悉的信任給我心安
You're too different from them, baby
I hope you know it, know it, know it
你的眼 流淌著波浪的藍
熙攘人潮湧動著舊愛新歡
I've been thinking about you lately
I hope you know it, know it, know it

Red bottom Louboutin and Yves Saint Laurent
房間散落滿地的星光
微妙顫動著的心臟
You know that I ain't ready yet
I know that you know where she at
Empty your glass and get outta my sight
Then tonight you'll be gone
But I know that we are better than that, babe

Why don't you stay with me?
貪婪地深呼吸氧氣
時而怯懦哽咽著我的勇氣
難開口唯一唯一唯一

你披著星辰來世界頂端
陌生熟悉的信任給我心安
You're too different from them, baby
I hope you know it, know it, know it
你的眼 流淌著波浪的藍
熙攘人潮湧動著舊愛新歡
I've been thinking about you lately
I hope you know it, know it, know it

不能說與你與你無關
腦海裡候鳥飛過湖藍
請你傾聽我沈默呼喊
I'm calling your name

你的眼 流淌著波浪的藍
熙攘人潮湧動著舊愛新歡
I've been thinking about you lately
I hope you know it, know it, know it

Why don't you stay with me?
貪婪地深呼吸氧氣
時而怯懦哽咽著我的勇氣
難開口唯一唯一唯一
